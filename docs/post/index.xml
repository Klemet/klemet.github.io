      <title>Hypothesis and predictions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a prediction, not an hypothesis&amp;rdquo; read the comment of one of my co-author. He was right : what I did present as one of the hypotheses of my research paper was, in fact, a prediction. But then, I started to notice that a majority of the articles I read seemed to do the same mistake. A couple of days ago, I read the following in a recent article in ecology (which I&amp;rsquo;m paraphrasing) :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hypothesize that climate warming and the increase in CO2 concentration will increase forest productivity and carbon stocks in our modeled landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is indeed a prediction disguised as an hypothesis. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty hard to see, and pretty easy to miss; but apparently, the consequences for science can be more dire than I imagined at first, when the problem was revealed to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-epidemic-of-confusion&#34;&gt;The epidemic of confusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of this confusion is not a new phenomenon. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/4451093&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;In 2001, Guy R. McPherson wrote an article&lt;/a&gt; pointing to the fact that a certain amount of scientists did not know how to make the difference, which lead to this kind of error in research papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these discussions begin with a question I pose to PhD. students at their oral comprehensive examination: &amp;ldquo;What is a hypothesis?&amp;rdquo; When I first began asking this question more than 10 years ago, nearly all students invoked Popper&amp;rsquo;s falsificationist view (e.g. Popper 1981), then proceeded to confuse hypothesis with prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another personal anecdote reinforces the view that scientists (including those outside my academic institution) may confuse &amp;ldquo;hypothesis&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;prediction.&amp;rdquo; In a recent manuscript, my co-author and I substituted the inappropriate term &amp;ldquo;hypothesis&amp;rdquo; for the appropriate term &amp;ldquo;prediction&amp;rdquo; throughout the manuscript (a total of seven times). The paper was submitted to a major international journal in 1998 and was subjected to a high level of scrutiny by three reviewers (presumably scientists who are reasonably well known), the associate editor, and the editor-in-chief (the latter two individuals are internationally renowned scientists). None of the five individuals in the review process commented on the inappropriate use of &amp;ldquo;hypothesis,&amp;rdquo; and the manuscript was published in the journal in 1999 (corrections were noted by the co-authors on the page proofs, and incorporated in the published manuscript).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/4451093&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;McPherson, 2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not believe that this problem is due to the fact that PhD students and researchers are not smart enough to grasp the difference; nor that it comes from a real desire to disguise one into the other. It could be due to the fact that the difference is not taught enough - or not well enough - in the university, or even before that. In fact, McPherson&amp;rsquo;s article was published in &lt;em&gt;The American Biology Teacher&lt;/em&gt;, and was first and foremost directed at science educators. If our teachers don&amp;rsquo;t know the difference well enough, it&amp;rsquo;s understandable that most student won&amp;rsquo;t know it past their diplomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again, I do not believe that any blame is to be given to science educators : it&amp;rsquo;s simply that the difference between hypothesis and predictions can be very subtle, and that it is easy to be influenced by the work or words of others that confuse the two. Hence, we end up in a kind of &lt;a href=&#34;http://datanuggets.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Strode_NABT-2011-Hypothesis-Presentation.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;epidemic of confusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-real-difference-between-hypotheses-and-predictions&#34;&gt;The real difference between hypotheses and predictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;predictions&#34;&gt;Predictions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we try to explain the difference between an hypothesis and a prediction, that&amp;rsquo;s where we start to see where the problem lies : it&amp;rsquo;s not always that easy to distinguish the two. From my understanding, there is no single method to be assured of what we&amp;rsquo;re doing, but only a set of clues. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to summarize them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-a-magic-8-ball-from-frankieleonhttpswwwflickrcomphotosarmydre20086521326205-on-flick&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./magic_8_ball.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A magic 8 ball from [frankieleon](https://www.flickr.com/photos/armydre2008/6521326205) on Flick.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we can say that a prediction is an affirmative statement about what will happen in certain conditions : they are all about patterns that can be observed. Most of all, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/4451093&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;McPherson (2001)&lt;/a&gt; points out, a &lt;strong&gt;prediction&lt;/strong&gt; does not need the scientific method to be validated or invalidated (in contrast to an hypothesis). In fact, we test predictions in our daily life without using any science at all. Even fortune tellers do it. Here are a couple of examples :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The salt is in this section of the supermarket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pastas are ready&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will rain tomorrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these are predictions, and only require observation - not experimentation - to be validated or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where it gets trickier is when we see predictions that concern things that are not in our daily lives, but that seems to touch the realm of &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo;. When they do, we might think that we are looking at an hypothesis. See the following statements :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no living organisms on Mars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate change will reduce the resilience of forests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An increase in protein X will lead to disease Y&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you; but I&amp;rsquo;m personally are much more inclined to identify those as hypotheses. But nothing has really changed were compared to the three statement regarding &amp;ldquo;everyday life&amp;rdquo; : we&amp;rsquo;re still making affirmations about something that will happen in certain conditions, which is a prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;rsquo;s an important catch that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/4451093&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;McPherson (2001)&lt;/a&gt; explains : that while testing predictions does not require the scientific method, it is in itself part of the scientific method, and part of what we call &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; overall. This is because sometimes, we have to just test a prediction to advance; wherever it is in order to validate or invalidate an hypothesis (that&amp;rsquo;s what is required to do it, after all), or because we need more information to formulate an hypothesis, or because the answer is really needed in the current context. &lt;strong&gt;Predictions are not &amp;ldquo;bad science&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;; they are a tool used by science, and necessary to science. The problem lies in confusing them with hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hypotheses&#34;&gt;Hypotheses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good way to identify an hypothesis is to see if the statement it contains can be an answer to a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This is because hypotheses should be propositions related to how a system function, which can then be tested by using an experiment. Of course, any hypothesis should be falsifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at a simple example : we have a flashlight that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t the flashlight work ?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; is a good example of a research question.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But if we say &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Is the flashlight not working because the batteries are empty&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, we&amp;rsquo;re already making an implied hypothesis, since we&amp;rsquo;re giving an explanation for why the system (the flashlight) works as it does. One thing at a time !&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The flashlight doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because the batteries are empty&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; is a hypothesis : it answers the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, and can be falsified.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another hypothesis can be &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The flashlight doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because the light bulb is broken&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that we have the hypothesis, we can propose an experiment to test it : we can change the batteries, and see if the flashlight will work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we can make a prediction that will come true if the hypothesis is validated : &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The flashlight will light up when we change the batteries&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important thing, according to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/4451093&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;McPherson (2001)&lt;/a&gt;, is to distinguish the hypothesis (a statement about how the system functions) with the &lt;em&gt;statistical&lt;/em&gt; hypothesis (which is really a prediction : a statement about the statistical pattern that we should observe &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the hypothesis is true).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-the-light-bulb-is-a-good-example-to-distinguish-the-prediction-and-hypothesis--saying-that-changing-it-will-make-the-light-work-is-a-prediction-saying-that-the-light-doesnt-work-because-the-light-bulb-needs-to-be-changed-is-a-hypothesis&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./lightbulb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The light bulb is a good example to distinguish the prediction and hypothesis : saying that changing it will make the light work is a prediction. Saying that the light doesn&amp;#39;t work because the light bulb needs to be changed is a hypothesis.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      The light bulb is a good example to distinguish the prediction and hypothesis : saying that changing it will make the light work is a prediction. Saying that the light doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because the light bulb needs to be changed is a hypothesis.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we come back to the first example that I gave of a prediction hiding as an hypothesis, the real hypothesis would be :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hypothesize that climate warming and CO2 concentration affects forest productivity and carbon stocks at the landscape scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to test this hypothesis is to make a modeling experiment : &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; we model a forest landscape with increasing climate warming and C02 concentration, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; we should see the productivity and carbon stocks increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the article is recent, and the idea that climate warming will increase forest productivity in some forests in some ways is already well known; it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that this is not the hypothesis that the authors wanted to test. But because it is not formulated in the right way, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to know what kind of information we will get in the end. And that&amp;rsquo;s one of the risks associated with making this confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a summary, a good way to identify an hypothesis (from my own point of view) is to see if it fits in the following sentence :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;experiment&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;prediction&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;because&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;hypothesis&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-it-so-important-to-distinguish-the-two-&#34;&gt;Why is it so important to distinguish the two ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusing hypotheses and predictions can be more problematic that we might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first problem is that by doing so, we can &lt;strong&gt;give wrong impression about what the scientific method is to the public&lt;/strong&gt;, and especially to students and young people. If we present the act of making a prediction and testing it with an observation as science, then many things that we do in our daily lives is &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;. Checking if the salt is in this sections of the supermarket is a good example : it&amp;rsquo;s as much science as saying &amp;ldquo;putting batteries into the flashlight will make it work&amp;rdquo;. It is &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of the scientific method, but it&amp;rsquo;s not enough. Making a prediction and validating it doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer a lot of information in itself; especially if we didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to design them so as to answer the real hypothesis as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second problem is that when researchers do this confusion, they show that they do not completely grasp the scientific method. &lt;strong&gt;This might be a contributing factor to the many problems that science is facing today&lt;/strong&gt; : the bias of publication towards studies that &amp;ldquo;validate hypotheses&amp;rdquo; or predictions; the fact that confounding factors are not taken into account while designing the experiment or observation made in the study; the lack of replicability ; the difficulty of synthesizing many studies that concern a particular topic; the misinterpretation of statistical analysis; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third problem is that it prevents us from &lt;strong&gt;recognizing research that is done without testing an hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;. As &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/4451093&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;McPherson (2001)&lt;/a&gt; states, most research in biology describes patterns rather than testing the mechanisms underlying of the patterns : and that&amp;rsquo;s OK. Not all research articles need to have an hypothesis, as a big part of formulating hypotheses and putting the scientific method to work is investigating patterns. For example, one would not test the hypothesis &amp;ldquo;tobacco causes lung cancer&amp;rdquo; without a previous investigation of the prevalence of lung cancers in tobacco smokers. Such an investigation would be part of &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; as a whole, but would not be testing any hypothesis : only observing patterns, or testing predictions. Maybe we should appreciate that better, and understand that &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; is not just using the scientific method : &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; is a also a big adventure of communication, funding, coordination, techniques and methods, relations, journals, and even policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s important to distinguish hypothesis from predictions; because it takes us away, as researchers, from the desire to fit the routine of &amp;ldquo;introduction, hypothesis, methods, results&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, and embrace the fact that &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; is a more complex affair that require adaptability and innovation. But more simply, it&amp;rsquo;s important to come back to the roots of our profession, and take the time to understand the basic concepts that we might sometimes forget and brush away. If you took the time to read this article - and if I made a good job writing it -, then we&amp;rsquo;re hopefully already part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Veganism and climate change</title>
      <link>https://klemet.github.io/post/veganism_and_climate_change/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://klemet.github.io/post/veganism_and_climate_change/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So called &amp;ldquo;vegan&amp;rdquo; diets and lifestyle have been a subject of debate, controversy, but also interest those past few years. The number of people trying this lifestyle &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/26/veganuary-movement-plant-based-food#:~:text=The%20UK%2Dbased%20campaign%2C%20which,2019%20and%20170%2C000%20in%202018&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;have been soaring in the last decade&lt;/a&gt;; activists have been publishing more and more &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dominionmovement.com/watch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;well-known documentaries revealing the dark side of animal agriculture&lt;/a&gt;; and many scientific studies have been advocating for the potential benefits of the lifestyle for the environment and climate change, as echoed by a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/chapter-5/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;special report of the IPCC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for many of us, veganism is a difficult and touchy subject. The whole concept can feel like an undeserved attack on traditions, jobs, or on other things that we hold dear. And yet, most of us agree with its ethical premises : we don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of hurting or killing animals when it&amp;rsquo;s not needed for our survival, and especially not when it&amp;rsquo;s for pleasure, comfort or habits, and that&amp;rsquo;s just what veganism is. In fact, the original definition from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vegansociety.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Vegan Society&lt;/a&gt; (the oldest vegan organisation in the world which first coined the term) says :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is something that most of us would certainly find noble. But the resulting tension between following those principles - or being asked to - and trying to protect things we hold dear can lead to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200203-the-hidden-biases-that-drive-anti-vegan-hatred&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;severe anti-vegan bias&lt;/a&gt; that can be quite hard to overcome. I know that it has been hard on me for quite some time, and that I&amp;rsquo;m not completely free of it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bias, associated with the incredible economic and ideological power of the animal agriculture industry, can make things hard to piece out when we look at the science behind vegan lifestyles. Some studies funded by the industry have been criticized by the scientific community; while the results of others have been exaggerated by activists to fit their narrative. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sydneyuniversitypress.com.au/products/128398&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Whole books are now dedicated to analyzing the process of deception&lt;/a&gt; steaming from there forces. Really, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big current talking point about veganism concerns its ability to help us reduce our impacts on the environment, and especially on climate change. If one should summarized why in two sentences, we could say that it&amp;rsquo;s all about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_efficiency&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ecological efficiency&lt;/a&gt; : at each level of a food chain, a great amount of energy coming from the level before is lost. Therefore, eating animals or they secretions imply that a great deal of the energy given to them as food - plants - will not be transformed as food for humans, but lost for the metabolism of the animal that is fed from. Meanwhile, eating plants avoids this loss - doubly so because plants are &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotroph&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;autotrophic beings&lt;/a&gt;. This is why, in a very paradoxical way, eating plants instead of animals means that we require much less plants to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I got interested in this subject, I came into the opportunity of updating an article concerning veganism on the famous website &lt;a href=&#34;https://skepticalscience.com/veganism.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Skeptical Science&lt;/a&gt;, made by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.climatechangecommunication.org/portfolio-view/john-cook/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;John Cook&lt;/a&gt; and his colleagues. While not perfect by any mean, I always admired the attempt at scientific rigor and communication that the site strives for. And so, after rounds of writing and peer-review, my version is now online. I think that it does a pretty great job at giving a broad picture of the topic, and its subtleties. The short answer is that yes, veganism can be a great way to reduce our impacts on the environment, with a pretty clear consensus emerging from recent studies and reports; but that it won&amp;rsquo;t save the world by itself, and that other behavioral changes (like not using a car or not taking the plane) have a bigger impact on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_footprint&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;climate footprint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;cta-group&#34;&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://skepticalscience.com/veganism.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34;btn btn-primary px-3 py-3&#34;&gt;Wanna check out my article on Skeptical Science ? Click here !&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  
  
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just touching the &amp;ldquo;environmental&amp;rdquo; argument for veganism, and not even touching the other environmental aspects (such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;land-use, freshwater use, eutrophication, and biodiversity&lt;/a&gt;). Whatever the truth of the matter, I believe that our ethics always go first; that&amp;rsquo;s why none of us would start eating dogs, even if it was clearly proven that this would help fight climate change. Because of this, I recommend taking a closer look at what it really is to kill an animal; to imagine what we would feel if we were the ones slicing their throat, and facing their terrified gaze, all in order to eat a steak whose taste will be forgotten in a matter of minutes. And that if it is something that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t do ourselves out of compassion, kindness and courage, maybe it is something that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t pay for either.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As human knowledge accumulates and our daily lives become ever more busy, it&amp;rsquo;s not wonder that we start feeling overwelmed as researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our human brain might be an amazing tool to discover and understand the world around us when compared to a cat&amp;rsquo;s or a dog&amp;rsquo;s equivalent, but it is still both biased and limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there exist many different tools that can help us to compensate for these issues. And the wonderful news is that they are &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, that they do not contain advertising, and that they do not sell information about yourself or your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of 3 open-source software that changed my life as a PhD student and early researcher, by allowing me to &lt;strong&gt;organize my references, my notes and my files&lt;/strong&gt; like never before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;joplin&#34;&gt;Joplin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./Joplin_logo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joplin is a note-taking application with many features.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an open-source and completely free software that allows you to create notes in the &amp;ldquo;Markdown&amp;rdquo; writing language, and to organize them in &amp;ldquo;notebooks&amp;rdquo;, and associate them with tags. &lt;strong&gt;It is an excellent alternative to software such as Evernote or Microsoft One Note&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, Joplin allows you to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gather all your written or graphic information in one place&lt;/strong&gt;: your class notes, your thoughts, your projects, your recipes, your shopping lists, your to-do lists, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find all this information very quickly&lt;/strong&gt; (in a few seconds) thanks to the search tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use it on any computer&lt;/strong&gt; (Windows, Mac, Linux) and &lt;strong&gt;on any phone&lt;/strong&gt; (android, IOs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synchronize your data on the cloud you choose&lt;/strong&gt; : Nextcloud (see below), Google Drive, One Drive, etc. So you can have all your data written everywhere, all the time, on any media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a fully customizable interface&lt;/strong&gt; that allows you to focus totally on what you are writing, so that you don&amp;rsquo;t waste time and attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export your notes in many ways&lt;/strong&gt;, with a format (markdown) that can be read anywhere and at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatically manage the images and files you insert in your notes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatically edit your notes&lt;/strong&gt; (so you can go back at any time if you made a mistake).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joplin is an amazing software to try your hand at note-taking tools, and maybe even at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt; method !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other wondful alternatives include &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zettlr.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Zettlr&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. However, I think that Joplin is the best place to start if you&amp;rsquo;re not used to such apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To download Joplin, take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://joplinapp.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;zotero&#34;&gt;Zotero&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./zotero_logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zotero is a bibliography management software.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having complete and rigorous bibliography information is necessary in academic documents (thesis, dissertation, article). It can also be very important for blog or website posts, videos, scripts, and many others. It can additionally be very useful for managing personal resources. The bibliography information of a document is called &amp;lsquo;meta-data&amp;rsquo;, i.e. data &lt;em&gt;about the document&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;outside the document&lt;/em&gt; (its title, its publication date, its author(s), etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zotero allows you to :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easily save all the metadata associated with a document&lt;/strong&gt; (title, authors, place of publication, date, URL, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associate notes or tags&lt;/strong&gt; to each reference or document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sort these references by category&lt;/strong&gt;s, or by their characteristics to find them easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download associated PDF files&lt;/strong&gt; when possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export bibliography files&lt;/strong&gt; that contain all the details of the references, so that they can be inserted into a document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insert and manage the bibliography of a document&lt;/strong&gt; in Microsoft Word, Libreoffice or Google Doc using its plugins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zotero have a wonderful community that devellops incredible plugins such as Better BibTex, Zotfile or MDnotes. All of these will allow you to connect your Zotero database to other software such as Joplin, Zettlr and Obsidian, or to export the annotations that you make in your &lt;code&gt;.pdf&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To download Zotero, you can go on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;nextcloud&#34;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./Nextcloud_logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nextcloud is a cloud software like Google Drive, allowing to host files, but also containing multiple very useful applications. However, unlike Google Drive, it is open-source and free&lt;/strong&gt;. You only need to host it on a server yourself, or choose an host (free, or subscription-based).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nextcloud allows you to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have an online file storage space that is totally yours&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have access to lots of different applications all open-source&lt;/strong&gt; that allow you to manage to-do lists, &lt;em&gt;kanban boards&lt;/em&gt;, calendars, contacts, notes, recipes, maps, track your phone&amp;rsquo;s location, collaborate on documents, and much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nextcloud is an incredible way to boost your productivity by organizing simply across devices, and I cannot recommand it enough. It is also perfect to host your Joplin notes in the cloud, or your Zettlr or Obsidian files. You can even save the &lt;code&gt;.pdf&lt;/code&gt; files of your zotero database with it ! Best of all, most of Nextcloud&amp;rsquo;s apps can synchronize very easily with your phone. Tasks on your phone ? Check. Calendar ? Check. Kanban boards ? Check. Recipes ? Check. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find an host or download nextcloud and host it yourself, you should look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextcloud.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the project&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;remember-to-contribute-&#34;&gt;Remember to contribute !&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these incredible programs are free, but they all represent hours and hours of hard work, along with the work of creating documentation, beautiful websites, and easy-to-use installer for people like you or me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using open-source software can be describe as a particular way of life, as these are often much more respectful of your privacy than software made by companies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, or even Macintosh. But the price to pay is often on the shoulder of the devellopers : they are the ones investing the work needed, and will often have nothing for themselves if the venture fails, with no add revenues or revenues from selling your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, &lt;strong&gt;if you start using one of these programs, remember to take the time to make a donation or a contribution to the project that they represent&lt;/strong&gt;. If the software pleases you, the team behind it have certainly earned it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about these software, how to use them and their functionalities, you should take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://klemet.github.io/Workshop-Organization-EN/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;free online workshop&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve created to help you discover them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just an afternoon before you, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn the most important thing about them; but you&amp;rsquo;ll also learn some great methods to use them properly, and even in tandem together !&lt;/p&gt;
