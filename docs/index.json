We simulated 30 development scenarios in a landscape of the Mauricie region by varying the use of uneven-aged management methods and the aggregation of cuts. Our results show that, in comparison with even-aged management management, uneven-aged management increases the density and operational costs of the forest road network, the amount of forest with old tree cohorts, and the per se fragmentation of these forests. In addition, in the boreal forest to the north of the landscape, forest fires tended to fragment old forests despite forest management, reducing the differences between management strategies.\nWe conclude that the choice of uneven-aged management must depend on the type of fragmentation and habitat considered, the patterns of fragmentation related to natural disturbances, and the perceived effects of per se fragmentation in the landscape.

Of concern is the impact of forest roads.

And the wonderful news is that they are free, that they do not contain advertising, and that they do not sell information about yourself or your data.\nHere is a list of 3 open-source software that changed my life as a PhD student and early researcher, by allowing me to organize my references, my notes and my files like never before.\nJoplin    Joplin is a note-taking application with many features.\nIt is an open-source and completely free software that allows you to create notes in the ‚ÄúMarkdown‚Äù writing language, and to organize them in ‚Äúnotebooks‚Äù, and associate them with tags. It is an excellent alternative to software such as Evernote or Microsoft One Note.\nIn particular, Joplin allows you to:\n Gather all your written or graphic information in one place: your class notes, your thoughts, your projects, your recipes, your shopping lists, your to-do lists, etc. Find all this information very quickly (in a few seconds) thanks to the search tools. Use it on any computer (Windows, Mac, Linux) and on any phone (android, IOs). Synchronize your data on the cloud you choose : Nextcloud (see below), Google Drive, One Drive, etc. So you can have all your data written everywhere, all the time, on any media. Have a fully customizable interface that allows you to focus totally on what you are writing, so that you don‚Äôt waste time and attention. Export your notes in many ways, with a format (markdown) that can be read anywhere and at any time. Automatically manage the images and files you insert in your notes. Automatically edit your notes (so you can go back at any time if you made a mistake). And much more.  Joplin is an amazing software to try your hand at note-taking tools, and maybe even at the Zettelkasten method !\nOther wondful alternatives include Zettlr, or Obsidian. However, I think that Joplin is the best place to start if you‚Äôre not used to such apps.\nTo download Joplin, take a look at its website !\nZotero    Zotero is a bibliography management software.\nHaving complete and rigorous bibliography information is necessary in academic documents (thesis, dissertation, article). It can also be very important for blog or website posts, videos, scripts, and many others. It can additionally be very useful for managing personal resources. The bibliography information of a document is called ‚Äòmeta-data‚Äô, i.e. data about the document, but outside the document (its title, its publication date, its author(s), etc.).\nZotero allows you to :\n Easily save all the metadata associated with a document (title, authors, place of publication, date, URL, etc.). Associate notes or tags to each reference or document. Sort these references by categorys, or by their characteristics to find them easily. Download associated PDF files when possible. Export bibliography files that contain all the details of the references, so that they can be inserted into a document. Insert and manage the bibliography of a document in Microsoft Word, Libreoffice or Google Doc using its plugins.  Zotero have a wonderful community that devellops incredible plugins such as Better BibTex, Zotfile or MDnotes. All of these will allow you to connect your Zotero database to other software such as Joplin, Zettlr and Obsidian, or to export the annotations that you make in your .pdf files.\nTo download Zotero, you can go on its website.\nNextcloud    Nextcloud is a cloud software like Google Drive, allowing to host files, but also containing multiple very useful applications. However, unlike Google Drive, it is open-source and free. You only need to host it on a server yourself, or choose an host (free, or subscription-based).\nNextcloud allows you to:\n Have an online file storage space that is totally yours. Have access to lots of different applications all open-source that allow you to manage to-do lists, kanban boards, calendars, contacts, notes, recipes, maps, track your phone‚Äôs location, collaborate on documents, and much more.  Nextcloud is an incredible way to boost your productivity by organizing simply across devices, and I cannot recommand it enough. It is also perfect to host your Joplin notes in the cloud, or your Zettlr or Obsidian files. You can even save the .pdf files of your zotero database with it ! Best of all, most of Nextcloud‚Äôs apps can synchronize very easily with your phone. Tasks on your phone ? Check. Calendar ? Check. Kanban boards ? Check. Recipes ? Check. The list goes on.\nTo find an host or download nextcloud and host it yourself, you should look at the project‚Äôs website.\nRemember to contribute !

Our results show that: (i) Two species are strongly diurnal: Cephalophus leucogaster, and Philantomba congica, (ii) two species are mostly diurnal: C.callipygus and C. nigrifrons, (iii) one species is strongly nocturnal: C.castaneus, (iv) and one species is mostly nocturnal: C.silvicultor. Analyses of temporal activities (for five species) identified four species pairs that highly overlapped (Œîtextasciicircum‚â•¬†0.80), and six pairs that weakly overlapped (Œîtextasciicircum between 0.06 and 0.35). Finally, co-occurrence tests reveal a truly random co-occurrence (plt \u003e 0.05 and pgt \u003e 0.05) for six species pairs, and a positive co-occurrence (pgt \u003c 0.05) for four pairs. Positive co-occurrences are particularly noted for pairs formed by C.callipygus with the other species (except C. nigrifrons). These results are essential for a better understanding of the coexistence of duikers and the ecology of poorly known species (C. leucogaster and C. nigrifrons), and provide clarification on the activity patterns of C. silvicultor which was subject to controversy.

While the benefits of uneven-aged management have been reported at the stand-scale and on short time periods, uncertainties remain concerning the impacts of uneven-aged management on longer time and wider spatial scales. Of concern are the impact of forest roads, as uneven-aged management necessitate more permanent roads and an increased road usage in order to accommodate shorter harvest rotations. These could in turn increase permanent forest lost, fauna road mortality, carbon emissions and operational costs for the industry.\nTo explore this question, we compared the impact of uneven-aged management with that of even-aged management at large time and spatial scales. We created a road extension for the LANDIS-II landscape simulation model, whose goal is to simulate the construction of forest roads to reach harvesting areas in a dynamic and spatially explicit way. Road trajectories are computed by minimizing construction costs according to existing roads, elevation, topography, water bodies, and soil types. We developed 20 scenarios with different proportions of harvested areas managed with uneven-aged or even aged management methods, for a given harvest wood volume. The scenarios also differed in the level of aggregation of the harvested areas, and in the presence of a pre-existing forest roads. We tested these scenarios over a planning horizon of 300 years on a landscape of 5 million hectares in Mauricie, Canada, and measured several characteristics of the road network for each scenario.\nOur results will further our understanding of the long-term impacts of management strategies in forested landscapes, and will also open new opportunities to explore the impact of forest roads around the world.\n","date":1589288400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589288400,"objectID":"9bc66c10c1a4f8528f3b7085192abce1","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/talk/the-influence-of-forest-road-networks-on-the-long-term-impacts-of-uneven-aged-management/","publishdate":"2020-05-12T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/the-influence-of-forest-road-networks-on-the-long-term-impacts-of-uneven-aged-management/","section":"event","summary":"Uneven-aged forest management is currently seen by many forest ecologists as an extensive management approach offering interesting compromises between timber production and other important ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, and social acceptability.","tags":["ecology","roads","uneven-aged forest management"],"title":"The influence of forest road networks on the long term impacts of uneven-aged management","type":"event"},{"authors":["Cl√©ment Hardy"],"categories":null,"content":"The caribou (Rangifer tarandus) faces many different pressures throughout Qu√©bec, making it a vulnerable species.

Indeed, forest roads increase predation by the grey wolf (Canis lupus) that uses them to move quickly through the landscape to track its prey. Moreover, forest roads also increase habitat fragmentation; which in turn generates stress, habitat avoidance, and ultimately affect feeding patterns.\nThe Minist√®re des For√™ts, de la Faune et des Parcs du Qu√©bec (MFFP), in charge of forest management and fauna protection, is faced with the difficult task of designing forest roads necessary to maintain the viability of the forest industry while reducing their negative impact on the caribou. As part of an internship at the MFFP, I have developed an open-source GIS-based tool capable of exploring different strategies for building forest road networks. The goal of this tool is to prevent the disturbance of areas important to the caribou populations, and to detect existing roads that could be removed in order to improve the situation.\nThe tool had to respect many criteria: it had to be quick and easy to use, while being flexible enough to explore different user-defined scenarios. Each scenario generates a forest road network that expands across the forest areas to be harvested. In this presentation, I will briefly describe the difficulties faced to solve the very complex problem of optimizing a road network. I will also explain how I simulated the wood flux through the network in order to determine its most important roads.\n","date":1576760400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576760400,"objectID":"bec16a32ed47d1a99866b5d84479b6ac","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/talk/roads-to-conservation/","publishdate":"2019-12-19T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/roads-to-conservation/","section":"event","summary":"The caribou (Rangifer tarandus) faces many different pressures throughout Qu√©bec, making it a vulnerable species.

Each cell in it represents a piece of the surface of it, and the LANDIS-II user can choose from different extensions in order to represent processes that impact the plant succession of the landscape forests.\nCurrently, the existing extensions make it possible to model forest fires, biological epidemics, chablis, and the effect of logging on wood harvesting. However, the goal of the LANDIS-II Foundation, which is responsible for the development of the model, is more ambitious: interested researchers are explicitly invited to develop new extensions thanks to a structure that allows extensions to be easily grafted onto the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the model.\nIt is in this context that our research project fits in, which aims to explore the effects of equitable and inequal forest management methods on large spatial and temporal scales. The more extensive uneven-aged forest management methods are currently presented by many researchers as an important alternative to the even-aged methods, but the impacts of their use have not yet been considered on a large scale.\nTo distinguish the effects of these methods at the landscape scale, however, we must take into account a process that has, to our knowledge, never been modeled in such a context: the construction of forest paths necessary for access to stands. To this end, we have started the development of a new extension for LANDIS-II. This extension will simulate the development and maintenance of a network of forest paths in a landscaped landscape, and the costs and effects associated with these paths. We will combine the use of this module with different forest management scenarios, in order to observe how the use of the Equian and Inequian methods influence the quantity and structure of paths in the landscape.\n","date":1556802000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556802000,"objectID":"c514ad3a3de2066a3f38afce52e0accf","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/talk/a-new-landis-ii-module-to-study-the-effects-of-roads-on-forest-landscapes/","publishdate":"2019-05-02T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/a-new-landis-ii-module-to-study-the-effects-of-roads-on-forest-landscapes/","section":"event","summary":"LANDIS-II is a spatially explicit model to simulate the evolution of a forest landscape represented by a raster.

Among these are spatially explicit models, in which processes and represented entities are placed in space. These models, now widely used and developed in number, then make it possible to simulate different scenarios to better understand or better predict the evolution of a studied system.\nIn order to simplify the use of these models and the calculations they generate, the spatial dimension of the model is generally ‚Äúdiscretized‚Äù. By this act, the space is then divided into more or less small cells depending on the resolution used. The geometric shape most used by modelers to cut out space is that of the square, which makes it possible to create regular grids, in addition to other advantages. This choice of geometry to discretize space can however be questioned, while it has been shown that it could have strong impacts on the results of a model.\nWe then decided to focus on the impact of this choice on the functioning of spatially explicit models in forest ecology. For this, we will reproduce the operation of several existing models well known in the field, and which represent an important process for forest ecosystems (e.g. natural disturbances). We will then run these models on different grids (e.g. square, hexagonal, irregular, etc.) to observe the effects of these on the results obtained. Results obtained from preliminary work suggest that such effects may indeed be important, but not for all types of processes.\n","date":1544533200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544533200,"objectID":"30a092bb74df8aa6e31927dd088ccbb4","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/talk/how-do-i-cut-this-forest-landscape-for-you-influence-of-space-tessellation-methods-on-modeling-in-forest-ecology/","publishdate":"2018-12-11T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/how-do-i-cut-this-forest-landscape-for-you-influence-of-space-tessellation-methods-on-modeling-in-forest-ecology/","section":"event","summary":"In recent decades, thanks to the increase in the computational capabilities of our computers, the fields of ecology and forestry have seen the appearance of new tools within them.
