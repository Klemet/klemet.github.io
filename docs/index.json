But why should we do such a thing, when anger is precisely the source of so many of our problems ? Only a true buddhist could sit through this paradox. But luckily, that’s what Rod Owens did, and what he shares with us through this wonderful book.\nWhile reading Love and Rage, I was sometimes confused to see Owens taking a lot of time delving into his own feelings and history, with a vocabulary that felt a bit mystical. Added to that, the text felt a bit unorganized, repeating its key points at very different locations of the book, and in different contexts. And yet, reading Love and Rage puts you in a kind of “flow” that is hard to describe. I think I’ve come to understand that this is often the style in which complex and paradoxical truths, like the ones touched upon by buddhism or zen, are best understood : not with a scientific and organized writing, but as a lazy stroll through the streets of wisdom with a friend. Indeed, it would be possible to synthesize many of the main ideas of Love and Rage in one simple sentence; but we wouldn’t necessarily accept it or understand it better.\nStill, I’ll try to summarize some of the most interesting point of the book here, with the caveat that they will be best understood by reading the whole thing. And I definitely recommend it, as it gives great insights on love, rage, but also on how they interact with systemic oppression.\nThe hidden truth of anger One of the key ideas of Love and Rage is that anger always comes from another emotion. This means that anger never comes out of nowhere - except in some very rare medical cases. In particular, anger comes from things that hurt us, or from desires that were not fulfilled.\nIn those situations, anger comes to save the day (or so it thinks). It arise with the promise of hurting or destroying the thing that hurt us, which will surely make the hurt stop. As such, it is easy to see why anger is there as a pretty logical evolutionary mechanism. You hurt me, I hurt you; then, you’ll surely stop hurting me in the future.\n   Lama Rod Owens, author of Love and Rage  But this is not really the case, because of two important facts that anger makes us forget : the first is that it is not always possible to hurt the things that hurt us. They might be inaccessible, or too powerful for us, or hurting them will take a long, long time. This is often the case when dealing with systems of injustice or oppression : you can’t hurt or destroy a system that easily. And even if you do, you’ll not necessarily see satisfying results. The second, Owens explains, is that even if we manage to hurt what hurt us, it will not necessarily heal the hurt that has been done in the first place - or not even prevent future hurt. If someone bumps into you and hurts you, pushing them hard will not heal the pain you’re feeling, and might make them more prone to escalate the situation, causing even more hurt.\nThose two realities - that we can’t always hurt back, and that it doesn’t solve anything - can easily create a vicious circle of anger and pain. This is because anger is good at hiding what caused it, and is also good at reinforcing itself. Hence, we’re hurt, and this makes us angry; anger makes us look away from the hurt, and focuses us on hurting back. Hurting back doesn’t heal us, and we get hurt even more. This means that we get angry even more, creating a positive feedback that can lead us to terrible situations.\nFrom the point of view of Owens, understanding this reality of anger is the first step to a form a healing. This healing, in turn, is essential for us today, because we are constantly hurt by an unfair reality. Especially if we are part of an oppressed minority, if we are an activist, or if we are a member of the oppressive majority that suffers the price of our status.\nHealing from anger with love Healing anything through love has always sounded to me like a very superficial sentence; the kind that you would see in a Facebook post or on a bumper sticker at the back of a car. The kind of things that people say to sound wise, but that they do not do, as it does not contain anything of substance. And while that might be right in some cases, there is an important truth in this sentence that Love and Rage made me humbly realize.\nWhat is love ? - Baby don’t hurt me…no more, says the song. And it’s pretty spot-on for the second key idea of Love and Rage. According to Owens, it’s important to understand what love actually is to start healing. And what love actually is, according to him, is really acceptation. Loving somebody, or something, means accepting them. In turn, accepting them does not mean justifying them, or thinking them good. It means that we take the time to let them be, to listen to them, and to consider them.\n   Picture by Simran Sood on Unsplash  As such, Owen uses love in a very “buddhist” sense (which makes …","date":1648598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648598400,"objectID":"b2d0957aef5ba733107afc5fd1bc9ac4","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/post/love_and_rage_owens_2020/","publishdate":"2022-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/love_and_rage_owens_2020/","section":"post","summary":"In world that always feels unfair, acceptation is the key to changing it.","tags":["book review","activism","anger","buddhism"],"title":"Book review : Love and Rage, The Path of Liberation through Anger by Lama Rod Owens","type":"post"},{"authors":["Clément Hardy"],"categories":null,"content":"“That’s a prediction, not an hypothesis” read the comment of one of my co-author. He was right : what I did present as one of the hypotheses of my research paper was, in fact, a prediction. But then, I started to notice that a majority of the articles I read seemed to do the same mistake. A couple of days ago, I read the following in a recent article in ecology (which I’m paraphrasing) :\n We hypothesize that climate warming and the increase in CO2 concentration will increase forest productivity and carbon stocks in our modeled landscape.\n Which is indeed a prediction disguised as an hypothesis. It’s pretty hard to see, and pretty easy to miss; but apparently, the consequences for science can be more dire than I imagined at first, when the problem was revealed to me.\nThe epidemic of confusion The prevalence of this confusion is not a new phenomenon. In 2001, Guy R. McPherson wrote an article pointing to the fact that a certain amount of scientists did not know how to make the difference, which lead to this kind of error in research papers.\n Most of these discussions begin with a question I pose to PhD. students at their oral comprehensive examination: “What is a hypothesis?” When I first began asking this question more than 10 years ago, nearly all students invoked Popper’s falsificationist view (e.g. Popper 1981), then proceeded to confuse hypothesis with prediction.\n  Another personal anecdote reinforces the view that scientists (including those outside my academic institution) may confuse “hypothesis” and “prediction.” In a recent manuscript, my co-author and I substituted the inappropriate term “hypothesis” for the appropriate term “prediction” throughout the manuscript (a total of seven times). The paper was submitted to a major international journal in 1998 and was subjected to a high level of scrutiny by three reviewers (presumably scientists who are reasonably well known), the associate editor, and the editor-in-chief (the latter two individuals are internationally renowned scientists). None of the five individuals in the review process commented on the inappropriate use of “hypothesis,” and the manuscript was published in the journal in 1999 (corrections were noted by the co-authors on the page proofs, and incorporated in the published manuscript).\n McPherson, 2001\nI do not believe that this problem is due to the fact that PhD students and researchers are not smart enough to grasp the difference; nor that it comes from a real desire to disguise one into the other. It could be due to the fact that the difference is not taught enough - or not well enough - in the university, or even before that. In fact, McPherson’s article was published in The American Biology Teacher, and was first and foremost directed at science educators. If our teachers don’t know the difference well enough, it’s understandable that most student won’t know it past their diplomas.\nBut again, I do not believe that any blame is to be given to science educators : it’s simply that the difference between hypothesis and predictions can be very subtle, and that it is easy to be influenced by the work or words of others that confuse the two. Hence, we end up in a kind of epidemic of confusion.\nThe real difference between hypotheses and predictions Predictions When we try to explain the difference between an hypothesis and a prediction, that’s where we start to see where the problem lies : it’s not always that easy to distinguish the two. From my understanding, there is no single method to be assured of what we’re doing, but only a set of clues. I’ll try to summarize them here.\n   A magic 8 ball from frankieleon on Flick.  In short, we can say that a prediction is an affirmative statement about what will happen in certain conditions : they are all about patterns that can be observed. Most of all, as McPherson (2001) points out, a prediction does not need the scientific method to be validated or invalidated (in contrast to an hypothesis). In fact, we test predictions in our daily life without using any science at all. Even fortune tellers do it. Here are a couple of examples :\n The salt is in this section of the supermarket The pastas are ready It will rain tomorrow  All of these are predictions, and only require observation - not experimentation - to be validated or not.\nWhere it gets trickier is when we see predictions that concern things that are not in our daily lives, but that seems to touch the realm of “science”. When they do, we might think that we are looking at an hypothesis. See the following statements :\n There are no living organisms on Mars Climate change will reduce the resilience of forests An increase in protein X will lead to disease Y  I don’t know about you; but I’m personally are much more inclined to identify those as hypotheses. But nothing has really changed were compared to the three statement regarding “everyday life” : we’re still making affirmations about something that will happen in certain conditions, which …","date":1646870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646870400,"objectID":"1dc79319c3d4e1a765204a7c7f8b7511","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/post/hypothesis_and_predictions/","publishdate":"2022-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hypothesis_and_predictions/","section":"post","summary":"Why the difference can be subtle, and why we should be careful about distinguishing the two.","tags":["epistemiology","hypothesis","prediction"],"title":"Hypothesis and predictions","type":"post"},{"authors":["Clément Hardy"],"categories":null,"content":"So called “vegan” diets and lifestyle have been a subject of debate, controversy, but also interest those past few years. The number of people trying this lifestyle have been soaring in the last decade; activists have been publishing more and more well-known documentaries revealing the dark side of animal agriculture; and many scientific studies have been advocating for the potential benefits of the lifestyle for the environment and climate change, as echoed by a recent special report of the IPCC.\nHowever, for many of us, veganism is a difficult and touchy subject. The whole concept can feel like an undeserved attack on traditions, jobs, or on other things that we hold dear. And yet, most of us agree with its ethical premises : we don’t like the idea of hurting or killing animals when it’s not needed for our survival, and especially not when it’s for pleasure, comfort or habits, and that’s just what veganism is. In fact, the original definition from the The Vegan Society (the oldest vegan organisation in the world which first coined the term) says :\n Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals.\n Which is something that most of us would certainly find noble. But the resulting tension between following those principles - or being asked to - and trying to protect things we hold dear can lead to a severe anti-vegan bias that can be quite hard to overcome. I know that it has been hard on me for quite some time, and that I’m not completely free of it today.\nThis bias, associated with the incredible economic and ideological power of the animal agriculture industry, can make things hard to piece out when we look at the science behind vegan lifestyles. Some studies funded by the industry have been criticized by the scientific community; while the results of others have been exaggerated by activists to fit their narrative. Whole books are now dedicated to analyzing the process of deception steaming from there forces. Really, it’s hard to keep track.\nOne of the big current talking point about veganism concerns its ability to help us reduce our impacts on the environment, and especially on climate change. If one should summarized why in two sentences, we could say that it’s all about ecological efficiency : at each level of a food chain, a great amount of energy coming from the level before is lost. Therefore, eating animals or they secretions imply that a great deal of the energy given to them as food - plants - will not be transformed as food for humans, but lost for the metabolism of the animal that is fed from. Meanwhile, eating plants avoids this loss - doubly so because plants are autotrophic beings. This is why, in a very paradoxical way, eating plants instead of animals means that we require much less plants to begin with.\nAs I got interested in this subject, I came into the opportunity of updating an article concerning veganism on the famous website Skeptical Science, made by John Cook and his colleagues. While not perfect by any mean, I always admired the attempt at scientific rigor and communication that the site strives for. And so, after rounds of writing and peer-review, my version is now online. I think that it does a pretty great job at giving a broad picture of the topic, and its subtleties. The short answer is that yes, veganism can be a great way to reduce our impacts on the environment, with a pretty clear consensus emerging from recent studies and reports; but that it won’t save the world by itself, and that other behavioral changes (like not using a car or not taking the plane) have a bigger impact on our climate footprint.\n Wanna check out my article on Skeptical Science ? Click here !   Of course, this is just touching the “environmental” argument for veganism, and not even touching the other environmental aspects (such as land-use, freshwater use, eutrophication, and biodiversity). Whatever the truth of the matter, I believe that our ethics always go first; that’s why none of us would start eating dogs, even if it was clearly proven that this would help fight climate change. Because of this, I recommend taking a closer look at what it really is to kill an animal; to imagine what we would feel if we were the ones slicing their throat, and facing their terrified gaze, all in order to eat a steak whose taste will be forgotten in a matter of minutes. And that if it is something that we couldn’t do ourselves out of compassion, kindness and courage, maybe it is something that we shouldn’t pay for either.\n","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"25e088924c33e11e402ef9e7eacde891","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/post/veganism_and_climate_change/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/veganism_and_climate_change/","section":"post","summary":"Plant-based diets have a high ecological efficiency; but is it really useful to help the planet ?","tags":["plant-based diets","climate change","veganism"],"title":"Veganism and climate change","type":"post"},{"authors":["Clément Hardy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646834766,"objectID":"cea6d60d5e967c9b65dfe1776147c80d","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/publication/hardy-veganism-best-way-2022/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T14:08:17.807561Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hardy-veganism-best-way-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Is Veganism the best way to reduce carbon emissions?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clément Hardy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646834769,"objectID":"3ea99172d35df9172d25c1018fe1b29c","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/publication/hardy-amenagement-forestier-inequien-2022/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T14:08:19.980776Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hardy-amenagement-forestier-inequien-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"L'aménagement forestier inéquien : Solution ou mirage d'une foresterie durable ?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clément Hardy"],"categories":null,"content":"   Uneven-aged forest management is perceived as offering attractive trade-offs between wood production, and other important ecosystem services.

And the wonderful news is that they are free, that they do not contain advertising, and that they do not sell information about yourself or your data.\nHere is a list of 3 open-source software that changed my life as a PhD student and early researcher, by allowing me to organize my references, my notes and my files like never before.\nJoplin    Joplin is a note-taking application with many features.\nIt is an open-source and completely free software that allows you to create notes in the “Markdown” writing language, and to organize them in “notebooks”, and associate them with tags. It is an excellent alternative to software such as Evernote or Microsoft One Note.\nIn particular, Joplin allows you to:\n Gather all your written or graphic information in one place: your class notes, your thoughts, your projects, your recipes, your shopping lists, your to-do lists, etc. Find all this information very quickly (in a few seconds) thanks to the search tools. Use it on any computer (Windows, Mac, Linux) and on any phone (android, IOs). Synchronize your data on the cloud you choose : Nextcloud (see below), Google Drive, One Drive, etc. So you can have all your data written everywhere, all the time, on any media. Have a fully customizable interface that allows you to focus totally on what you are writing, so that you don’t waste time and attention. Export your notes in many ways, with a format (markdown) that can be read anywhere and at any time. Automatically manage the images and files you insert in your notes. Automatically edit your notes (so you can go back at any time if you made a mistake). And much more.  Joplin is an amazing software to try your hand at note-taking tools, and maybe even at the Zettelkasten method !\nOther wondful alternatives include Zettlr, or Obsidian. However, I think that Joplin is the best place to start if you’re not used to such apps.\nTo download Joplin, take a look at its website !\nZotero    Zotero is a bibliography management software.\nHaving complete and rigorous bibliography information is necessary in academic documents (thesis, dissertation, article). It can also be very important for blog or website posts, videos, scripts, and many others. It can additionally be very useful for managing personal resources. The bibliography information of a document is called ‘meta-data’, i.e. data about the document, but outside the document (its title, its publication date, its author(s), etc.).\nZotero allows you to :\n Easily save all the metadata associated with a document (title, authors, place of publication, date, URL, etc.). Associate notes or tags to each reference or document. Sort these references by categorys, or by their characteristics to find them easily. Download associated PDF files when possible. Export bibliography files that contain all the details of the references, so that they can be inserted into a document. Insert and manage the bibliography of a document in Microsoft Word, Libreoffice or Google Doc using its plugins.  Zotero have a wonderful community that devellops incredible plugins such as Better BibTex, Zotfile or MDnotes. All of these will allow you to connect your Zotero database to other software such as Joplin, Zettlr and Obsidian, or to export the annotations that you make in your .pdf files.\nTo download Zotero, you can go on its website.\nNextcloud    Nextcloud is a cloud software like Google Drive, allowing to host files, but also containing multiple very useful applications. However, unlike Google Drive, it is open-source and free. You only need to host it on a server yourself, or choose an host (free, or subscription-based).\nNextcloud allows you to:\n Have an online file storage space that is totally yours. Have access to lots of different applications all open-source that allow you to manage to-do lists, kanban boards, calendars, contacts, notes, recipes, maps, track your phone’s location, collaborate on documents, and much more.  Nextcloud is an incredible way to boost your productivity by organizing simply across devices, and I cannot recommand it enough. It is also perfect to host your Joplin notes in the cloud, or your Zettlr or Obsidian files. You can even save the .pdf files of your zotero database with it ! Best of all, most of Nextcloud’s apps can synchronize very easily with your phone. Tasks on your phone ? Check. Calendar ? Check. Kanban boards ? Check. Recipes ? Check. The list goes on.\nTo find an host or download nextcloud and host it yourself, you should look at the project’s website.\nRemember to contribute !

But uncertainties remain concerning its impacts on longer time periods and broader spatial scales, where harvesting activities and forest roads construction can impact the composition and fragmentation of the landscape.\nConsequently, we explored the impacts of uneven-aged management at the landscape scale and on a planning horizon of 150 years by using the forest landscape model LANDIS-II, along with an extension allowing for the dynamic simulation of the forest road network.

While benefits of uneven-aged management have been reported at the stand-scale and for short time periods, uncertainties remain concerning its impacts for longer time periods and broader spatial scales. Of concern is the impact of forest roads. Indeed, uneven-aged forestry requires that silvicultural operations extend over larger forest areas than even-aged forestry in order to harvest the same volume of wood. Consequently, uneven-aged forestry may require a larger and more permanent forest road network to reach distant stands over shorter rotation periods.\nHere, we explored the impacts of uneven-aged management on the composition and fragmentation of a 800 000 ha landscape over a 150 years-planning horizon. We used the forest landscape model LANDIS-II, along with an extension that simulates the expansion of the forest road network.

The study of their activity patterns is needed to better understand habitat use or association between the species. Using camera traps, we studied the temporal activity patterns, and quantified for the first time the temporal overlap and spatial co-occurrence between species. Our results show that: (i) Two species are strongly diurnal: Cephalophus leucogaster, and Philantomba congica, (ii) two species are mostly diurnal: C.callipygus and C. nigrifrons, (iii) one species is strongly nocturnal: C.castaneus, (iv) and one species is mostly nocturnal: C.silvicultor. Analyses of temporal activities (for five species) identified four species pairs that highly overlapped (Δtextasciicircum≥ 0.80), and six pairs that weakly overlapped (Δtextasciicircum between 0.06 and 0.35). Finally, co-occurrence tests reveal a truly random co-occurrence (plt \u003e 0.05 and pgt \u003e 0.05) for six species pairs, and a positive co-occurrence (pgt \u003c 0.05) for four pairs. Positive co-occurrences are particularly noted for pairs formed by C.callipygus with the other species (except C. nigrifrons). These results are essential for a better understanding of the coexistence of duikers and the ecology of poorly known species (C. leucogaster and C. nigrifrons), and provide clarification on the activity patterns of C. silvicultor which was subject to controversy.

Of concern are the impact of forest roads, as uneven-aged management necessitate more permanent roads and an increased road usage in order to accommodate shorter harvest rotations. These could in turn increase permanent forest lost, fauna road mortality, carbon emissions and operational costs for the industry.\nTo explore this question, we compared the impact of uneven-aged management with that of even-aged management at large time and spatial scales. We created a road extension for the LANDIS-II landscape simulation model, whose goal is to simulate the construction of forest roads to reach harvesting areas in a dynamic and spatially explicit way. Road trajectories are computed by minimizing construction costs according to existing roads, elevation, topography, water bodies, and soil types. We developed 20 scenarios with different proportions of harvested areas managed with uneven-aged or even aged management methods, for a given harvest wood volume. The scenarios also differed in the level of aggregation of the harvested areas, and in the presence of a pre-existing forest roads. We tested these scenarios over a planning horizon of 300 years on a landscape of 5 million hectares in Mauricie, Canada, and measured several characteristics of the road network for each scenario.\nOur results will further our understanding of the long-term impacts of management strategies in forested landscapes, and will also open new opportunities to explore the impact of forest roads around the world.\n","date":1589288400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589288400,"objectID":"9bc66c10c1a4f8528f3b7085192abce1","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/talk/the-influence-of-forest-road-networks-on-the-long-term-impacts-of-uneven-aged-management/","publishdate":"2020-05-12T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/the-influence-of-forest-road-networks-on-the-long-term-impacts-of-uneven-aged-management/","section":"event","summary":"Uneven-aged forest management is currently seen by many forest ecologists as an extensive management approach offering interesting compromises between timber production and other important ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, and social acceptability.","tags":["ecology","roads","uneven-aged forest management"],"title":"The influence of forest road networks on the long term impacts of uneven-aged management","type":"event"},{"authors":["Clément Hardy"],"categories":null,"content":"The caribou (Rangifer tarandus) faces many different pressures throughout Québec, making it a vulnerable species.

Moreover, forest roads also increase habitat fragmentation; which in turn generates stress, habitat avoidance, and ultimately affect feeding patterns.\nThe Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs du Québec (MFFP), in charge of forest management and fauna protection, is faced with the difficult task of designing forest roads necessary to maintain the viability of the forest industry while reducing their negative impact on the caribou.

However, the goal of the LANDIS-II Foundation, which is responsible for the development of the model, is more ambitious: interested researchers are explicitly invited to develop new extensions thanks to a structure that allows extensions to be easily grafted onto the “heart” of the model.\nIt is in this context that our research project fits in, which aims to explore the effects of equitable and inequal forest management methods on large spatial and temporal scales. The more extensive uneven-aged forest management methods are currently presented by many researchers as an important alternative to the even-aged methods, but the impacts of their use have not yet been considered on a large scale.\nTo distinguish the effects of these methods at the landscape scale, however, we must take into account a process that has, to our knowledge, never been modeled in such a context: the construction of forest paths necessary for access to stands. To this end, we have started the development of a new extension for LANDIS-II. This extension will simulate the development and maintenance of a network of forest paths in a landscaped landscape, and the costs and effects associated with these paths.

By this act, the space is then divided into more or less small cells depending on the resolution used. The geometric shape most used by modelers to cut out space is that of the square, which makes it possible to create regular grids, in addition to other advantages.

For this, we will reproduce the operation of several existing models well known in the field, and which represent an important process for forest ecosystems (e.g. natural disturbances).
