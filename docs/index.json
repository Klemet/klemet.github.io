Methods : ‚ÄÉ We simulated an 800,000 ha forested landscape in the Mauricie region (Quebec, Canada) over a 150-year planning horizon with the LANDISII model and an extension that simulates forest road construction. We compared 30 different management scenarios that varied the proportion of even- and uneven-aged managements, the level of aggregation of the harvested areas, and the presence of pre-existing forest roads. Results : ‚ÄÉ Compared with even-aged management, uneven-aged management increased (i) the density of forest roads and their operational costs, (ii) the amount of old forests, and (iii) their fragmentation. Aggregating harvested areas did not noticeably reduce road density, and the presence of an initial road network had no long-term effects. Differences in landscape fragmentation between scenarios were reduced in the northern region of the landscape due to the fire regime. Conclusions : ‚ÄÉChoosing uneven-aged over evenaged management represents a trade-off between the amount of old forests in the landscape and three variables related to roads: their density, their related cost, and the fragmentation per se that they generate, This trade-off seems to disappear in the presence of stand-replacing disturbances in the landscape and is","tags":["landscape ecology","forestry","forest roads","LANDIS-II"],"title":"Land sparing and sharing patterns in forestry - exploring even-aged and uneven-aged management at the landscape scale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cl√©ment Hardy"],"categories":null,"content":" This post is a translation of an article I wrote for a science communication contest. See here to know more. What if our cars used less gaz? And our telephones less electricity? What if we replaced letters with e-mails? Would that help solve the ecological crisis? Certainly not, says a book that‚Äôs almost two centuries old.\nJevons paradox In 1865, Williams Stanley Jevons published a book entitled ‚ÄúThe Coal Question‚Äù. In it, Jevons makes the following observation: in England, the overall consumption of coal increased enormously after the invention of new, more efficient steam engines. Thus, a technological innovation reduced the consumption of a resource on an individual scale, but increased the overall consumption of that resource in society.\nThis contradiction is known as Jevons‚Äô paradox. It‚Äôs explained by the fact that increasing the efficiency of a technology reduces its cost of use, which in turn increases its utilization and overall resource consumption. 150 years on, this paradox continues to hang over us. After all, isn‚Äôt that new smartphone that consumes less electricity tempting, with its beautiful ‚Äúsustainable development‚Äù logo? And that new car that uses less gaz, with its ‚Äúgood for the planet‚Äù label?\nEfficiency, an often misleading marketing tactic As you may have gathered by now, Jevons‚Äô paradox fits in well with our consumer society. For example, it has been observed in the automobile sector for some time now. Cars that consume less mean cars that are cheaper to drive on a daily basis, and therefore an incentive to drive more. The same applies to aircrafts. In 50 years, aircraft fuel consumption per kilometer has fallen by 70%. But at the same time, the price of flights has fallen, and the number of flights has soared. As a result, global GHG emissions from aviation have risen by 400% over the same period.\nJevons paradox encapsulated in one add : we might think that we‚Äôre helping the environment by using a plane that has lower emissions. But all that we‚Äôre doing is using a plane when we might avoid it, for cheaper, and use the rest of our money to buy another product that will also pollute. In the end, we‚Äôre just polluting as much or even more than with a plane that consumes more fuel than this one. If we were to continue the list, it would be long: from intensive agriculture, which has increased our surface area used for farming , to e-mails, which have increased - not decreased - global paper consumption , Jevons‚Äô paradox is illustrated everywhere in our societies. It calls into question the seductive proposition that we can save the planet by innovating a little more, and buying the latest version of a popular product.\nA social solution rather than a technological one ? Fortunately for us, Jevons‚Äô paradox is not inevitable. It depends on many economic conditions that are not always respected, and which can be avoided. For example, a well-placed tax can avoid its appearance by preventing a reduction in the cost of use.\nDespite this, Jevons‚Äô paradox suggests that technological innovation will not be the solution to our environmental problems. Our societies will have to rethink the value we place on nature, and how to limit or reverse our growth while ensuring our well-being. Indeed, it is only by placing limits on growth that innovation can truly help our environment.\n","date":1686355200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686355200,"objectID":"527659cc32fc398708e46d6a50c86dbb","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/post/2023_intheshadowofjevons/","publishdate":"2023-06-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2023_intheshadowofjevons/","section":"post","summary":"When efficiency brings environmental destruction","tags":["paradox","carbon emissions","capitalism"],"title":"In the shadow of Jevons","type":"post"},{"authors":["Cl√©ment Hardy"],"categories":null,"content":"In 2023, the NSERC (an organisation of the federal government of Canada that finances scientific research) launched another edition of their ‚ÄúScience Action !‚Äù contest.

Existing tools to simulate the construction of forest roads have been designed for tactical or operational planning purposes, for relatively small areas (\u003c10 000 ha) and small-scale topographic information. Hence, no forest road simulation tool properly exists to assist forest landscape ecology and management research. Here, we present the Forest Roads Simulation (FRS) extension for the LANDIS-II model‚Äîa spatially explicit landscape simulation model of forest succession and disturbances. The FRS extension simulates forest road networks via a least-cost path algorithm accounting for landscape structure, decision inputs, and forest road types. We demonstrate the accuracy with which the FRS extension reproduces several key characteristics of existing road networks in two managed regions in Quebec, Canada: road density, road position, and fragmentation of the landscape. The FRS extension is easy to parameterize, proposing many options for researchers to simulate forest road networks at a strategic level in managed landscapes. It can tackle new research questions investigating the effects of forest roads within management strategies, such as the cost of road construction and habitat fragmentation, across large management units and long planning horizons.","tags":["landscape ecology","forestry","forest roads","LANDIS-II"],"title":"A LANDIS-II extension for simulating forest road networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guillemette Labadie","Cl√©ment Hardy","Yan Boulanger","Virginie Vanlandeghem","Mark Hebblewhite","Daniel Fortin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1679788800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679788800,"objectID":"ef9a34cfdf48a4f391e7813c0dd5c3ca","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/publication/labadie-prey-predator-dynamic/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T14:08:15.772224Z","relpermalink":"/publication/labadie-prey-predator-dynamic/","section":"publication","summary":"Although global change can reshape ecosystems by triggering cascading effects on food webs, indirect interactions remain largely overlooked. Climate- and land-use-induced changes in landscape cause shifts in vegetation composition, which affect entire food webs. We used simulations of forest dynamics and movements of interacting species, parameterized by empirical observations, to predict the outcomes of global change on a large-mammal food web in the boreal forest. We demonstrate that climate- and land-use-induced changes in forest landscapes exacerbate asymmetrical apparent competition between moose and threatened caribou populations through wolf predation. Although increased prey mortalities came from both behavioral and numerical responses, indirect effects from numerical responses had an overwhelming effect. The increase in caribou mortalities was exacerbated by the cumulating effects of land use over the short term and climate change impacts over the long term, with higher impact of land use. Indirect trophic interactions will be key to understanding community dynamics under global change.","tags":["predator-prey dynamics","climate change","forest ecology","forestry"],"title":"Global change risks a threatened species due to alteration of predator‚Äìprey dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabrielle Anctil"],"categories":null,"content":"The forests in Quebec are facing a lot of different pressures, resulting in different stakeholders arguing for different actions to help them.

Against me was the strength and cunning of a whole fantasy world that wanted me dead, dead, and dead again. Every enemy, encounter and trap carefully planned and placed to crush me and my foolish ambitions by video-game designers half a world away. Armed with my sword, I launched myself at a huge armored knight towering before me - one of the many, many ‚Äúbosses‚Äù of the game blocking my path to the Elden Ring. I had beaten many video-games before this one, and fought many knights taller than me a great number of times. I was confident that this time would not be different.\nBut the knight barely flinched at my blade, and retaliated before I could even finish my strike. Hurt, I rolled away, trying to escape his sword for one moment. With some distance between us, I quickly took out the magical flask that would heal me. But the knight knew better; and while I was drinking, he impaled me with his sword. Dead. But as my character had the strange curse of not being able to die, I tried again. And died again. And tried again. And died again. And again. And again. And again.\nI put my controller on the table, frustrated at the game; but even more frustrated at me. Here I was, a boy living in one of the most comfortable places on earth, wasting my time in frustration at a video-game. Yet, my affection for games is not always unjustified : I love games because many of them taught me very valuable lessons. They also gave me calm and relaxation when I needed them, along with some great fun with my friends. The truth was that I just didn‚Äôt understood the lesson that Elden Ring had to teach me at this time; and what a lesson it was, indeed !\nThe most difficult games Elden Ring is not any game. It has been a huge success since its release, with million of players enjoying its enormous and detailed world of decaying fantasy. An important part of its renown comes from its pedigree, as it‚Äôs the last creation of Fromsoft - a studio well known for its dark, difficult, but ultimately very rewarding games. In particular, the Dark Souls series that preceded Elden Ring was celebrated and almost universally known among gamers. It was also known as some of the most difficult games ever made. But many would say that this difficulty aspect was really overplayed; that it was not that difficult, but that it simply asked the player to be cautious and engaged with its world.\nI‚Äôve never been a huge fan of the Dark Souls series, as I always found it too frustrating. In my student life, I often played games to relax and unwind; not to be repeatedly killed by traps, rats, dogs, humans, monsters, statues, cliffs, and many others colorful things that Dark Souls can offer. Still, I‚Äôve always pondered the possibility that there was something in those games that I couldn‚Äôt see, and that gave so many over players joy and satisfaction. And with Elden Ring, I think that I finally found what this was.\nIndeed, playing Elden Ring made me re-think many of my habits as a player; and in particular, my relation to the famous Game over screen. In Dark Souls or in Elden Ring, this screen simply says You died; and as a player, it‚Äôs easy to take it as a sign that you did something wrong. That you should feel bad, and that this feeling of failure is a part of what will ultimately push you to better protect your character next time, and win. I think that most gamers would agree that that‚Äôs how a Game over screen feels in most games; it‚Äôs a small punishment, but a punishment all the same. A just punishment. The same one that happens when the opposite team scores a goal in your soccer match : you just want to avoid it more afterward, and it‚Äôs really a part of the funs in many ways.\nBut in Elden Ring, I‚Äôve found that seeing this Game over screen as a sign of failure doomed me to get into a circle of frustration. The more I died, the more I got excited to win; but then, I started to get stressed; and then, frustrated; and all the time, I would become worse and worse in the fight. I would die to the knight more and more quickly, sometimes without even being able to hit him once. And here was the lesson : the Game over was a failure, but not the one that I imagined. It was a lesson more than a failure, and one that connected to an awesome bit of psychology : the Yerkes-Dodson law.\nYou died | You learned The Yerkes-Dodson law is absolutely fascinating, especially when you take into account its ‚Äúzone of delusion‚Äù. Basically, the law describes a possible relationship between pressure and performance at different tasks in humans. Interestingly, it can be shown as a bell-shaped curve; what that means is that we perform better when we have a certain amount of pressure put on us. But even more interestingly, it means that as soon as the pressure gets too high, our productivity drops. This is called the zone of delusion, because in this zone, we can often get tricked by our emotions into thinking ‚Äúif I were a ‚Ä¶","date":1649116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649116800,"objectID":"8e022b23d034e9fb424e5a98b3b6d4ba","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/post/elden_ring_and_yerkes_dodson_law/","publishdate":"2022-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/elden_ring_and_yerkes_dodson_law/","section":"post","summary":"Or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the boss.","tags":["video-games","anxiety","stress","productivity"],"title":"Elden Ring and the Yerkes-Dodson law","type":"post"},{"authors":["Cl√©ment Hardy"],"categories":null,"content":"Recommendation : ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nLove and Rage is a call to accepting and appreciating our anger, rather than distrust and avoid it. But why should we do such a thing, when anger is precisely the source of so many of our problems ? Only a true buddhist could sit through this paradox. But luckily, that‚Äôs what Rod Owens did, and what he shares with us through this wonderful book.\nWhile reading Love and Rage, I was sometimes confused to see Owens taking a lot of time delving into his own feelings and history, with a vocabulary that felt a bit mystical. Added to that, the text felt a bit unorganized, repeating its key points at very different locations of the book, and in different contexts. And yet, reading Love and Rage puts you in a kind of ‚Äúflow‚Äù that is hard to describe. I think I‚Äôve come to understand that this is often the style in which complex and paradoxical truths, like the ones touched upon by buddhism or zen, are best understood : not with a scientific and organized writing, but as a lazy stroll through the streets of wisdom with a friend. Indeed, it would be possible to synthesize many of the main ideas of Love and Rage in one simple sentence; but we wouldn‚Äôt necessarily accept it or understand it better.\nStill, I‚Äôll try to summarize some of the most interesting point of the book here, with the caveat that they will be best understood by reading the whole thing. And I definitely recommend it, as it gives great insights on love, rage, but also on how they interact with systemic oppression.\nThe hidden truth of anger One of the key ideas of Love and Rage is that anger always comes from another emotion. This means that anger never comes out of nowhere - except in some very rare medical cases. In particular, anger comes from things that hurt us, or from desires that were not fulfilled.\nIn those situations, anger comes to save the day (or so it thinks). It arise with the promise of hurting or destroying the thing that hurt us, which will surely make the hurt stop. As such, it is easy to see why anger is there as a pretty logical evolutionary mechanism. You hurt me, I hurt you; then, you‚Äôll surely stop hurting me in the future.\nLama Rod Owens, author of Love and Rage But this is not really the case, because of two important facts that anger makes us forget : the first is that it is not always possible to hurt the things that hurt us. They might be inaccessible, or too powerful for us, or hurting them will take a long, long time. This is often the case when dealing with systems of injustice or oppression : you can‚Äôt hurt or destroy a system that easily. And even if you do, you‚Äôll not necessarily see satisfying results. The second, Owens explains, is that even if we manage to hurt what hurt us, it will not necessarily heal the hurt that has been done in the first place - or not even prevent future hurt. If someone bumps into you and hurts you, pushing them hard will not heal the pain you‚Äôre feeling, and might make them more prone to escalate the situation, causing even more hurt.\nThose two realities - that we can‚Äôt always hurt back, and that it doesn‚Äôt solve anything - can easily create a vicious circle of anger and pain. This is because anger is good at hiding what caused it, and is also good at reinforcing itself. Hence, we‚Äôre hurt, and this makes us angry; anger makes us look away from the hurt, and focuses us on hurting back. Hurting back doesn‚Äôt heal us, and we get hurt even more. This means that we get angry even more, creating a positive feedback that can lead us to terrible situations.\nFrom the point of view of Owens, understanding this reality of anger is the first step to a form a healing. This healing, in turn, is essential for us today, because we are constantly hurt by an unfair reality. Especially if we are part of an oppressed minority, if we are an activist, or if we are a member of the oppressive majority that suffers the price of our status.\nHealing from anger with love Healing anything through love has always sounded to me like a very superficial sentence; the kind that you would see in a Facebook post or on a bumper sticker at the back of a car. The kind of things that people say to sound wise, but that they do not do, as it does not contain anything of substance. And while that might be right in some cases, there is an important truth in this sentence that Love and Rage made me humbly realize.\nWhat is love ? - Baby don‚Äôt hurt me‚Ä¶no more, says the song. And it‚Äôs pretty spot-on for the second key idea of Love and Rage. According to Owens, it‚Äôs important to understand what love actually is to start healing. And what love actually is, according to him, is really acceptation. Loving somebody, or something, means accepting them. In turn, accepting them does not mean justifying them, or thinking them good. It means that we take the time to let them be, to listen to them, and to consider them.\nPicture by Simran Sood on Unsplash As such, Owen uses love in a very ‚Äúbuddhist‚Äù sense (which makes sense, being ‚Ä¶","date":1648598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648598400,"objectID":"b2d0957aef5ba733107afc5fd1bc9ac4","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/post/love_and_rage_owens_2020/","publishdate":"2022-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/love_and_rage_owens_2020/","section":"post","summary":"In world that always feels unfair, acceptation is the key to changing it.","tags":["book review","activism","anger","buddhism"],"title":"Book review : Love and Rage, The Path of Liberation through Anger by Lama Rod Owens","type":"post"},{"authors":["Cl√©ment Hardy"],"categories":null,"content":"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a prediction, not an hypothesis‚Äù read the comment of one of my co-author. He was right : what I did present as one of the hypotheses of my research paper was, in fact, a prediction. But then, I started to notice that a majority of the articles I read seemed to do the same mistake. A couple of days ago, I read the following in a recent article in ecology (which I‚Äôm paraphrasing) :\nWe hypothesize that climate warming and the increase in CO2 concentration will increase forest productivity and carbon stocks in our modeled landscape.\nWhich is indeed a prediction disguised as an hypothesis. It‚Äôs pretty hard to see, and pretty easy to miss; but apparently, the consequences for science can be more dire than I imagined at first, when the problem was revealed to me.\nThe epidemic of confusion The prevalence of this confusion is not a new phenomenon. In 2001, Guy R. McPherson wrote an article pointing to the fact that a certain amount of scientists did not know how to make the difference, which lead to this kind of error in research papers.\nMost of these discussions begin with a question I pose to PhD. students at their oral comprehensive examination: ‚ÄúWhat is a hypothesis?‚Äù When I first began asking this question more than 10 years ago, nearly all students invoked Popper‚Äôs falsificationist view (e.g. Popper 1981), then proceeded to confuse hypothesis with prediction.\nAnother personal anecdote reinforces the view that scientists (including those outside my academic institution) may confuse ‚Äúhypothesis‚Äù and ‚Äúprediction.‚Äù In a recent manuscript, my co-author and I substituted the inappropriate term ‚Äúhypothesis‚Äù for the appropriate term ‚Äúprediction‚Äù throughout the manuscript (a total of seven times). The paper was submitted to a major international journal in 1998 and was subjected to a high level of scrutiny by three reviewers (presumably scientists who are reasonably well known), the associate editor, and the editor-in-chief (the latter two individuals are internationally renowned scientists). None of the five individuals in the review process commented on the inappropriate use of ‚Äúhypothesis,‚Äù and the manuscript was published in the journal in 1999 (corrections were noted by the co-authors on the page proofs, and incorporated in the published manuscript).\nMcPherson, 2001\nI do not believe that this problem is due to the fact that PhD students and researchers are not smart enough to grasp the difference; nor that it comes from a real desire to disguise one into the other. It could be due to the fact that the difference is not taught enough - or not well enough - in the university, or even before that. In fact, McPherson‚Äôs article was published in The American Biology Teacher, and was first and foremost directed at science educators. If our teachers don‚Äôt know the difference well enough, it‚Äôs understandable that most student won‚Äôt know it past their diplomas.\nBut again, I do not believe that any blame is to be given to science educators : it‚Äôs simply that the difference between hypothesis and predictions can be very subtle, and that it is easy to be influenced by the work or words of others that confuse the two. Hence, we end up in a kind of epidemic of confusion.\nThe real difference between hypotheses and predictions Predictions When we try to explain the difference between an hypothesis and a prediction, that‚Äôs where we start to see where the problem lies : it‚Äôs not always that easy to distinguish the two. From my understanding, there is no single method to be assured of what we‚Äôre doing, but only a set of clues. I‚Äôll try to summarize them here.\nA magic 8 ball from frankieleon on Flick. In short, we can say that a prediction is an affirmative statement about what will happen in certain conditions : they are all about patterns that can be observed. Most of all, as McPherson (2001) points out, a prediction does not need the scientific method to be validated or invalidated (in contrast to an hypothesis). In fact, we test predictions in our daily life without using any science at all. Even fortune tellers do it. Here are a couple of examples :\nThe salt is in this section of the supermarket The pastas are ready It will rain tomorrow All of these are predictions, and only require observation - not experimentation - to be validated or not.\nWhere it gets trickier is when we see predictions that concern things that are not in our daily lives, but that seems to touch the realm of ‚Äúscience‚Äù. When they do, we might think that we are looking at an hypothesis. See the following statements :\nThere are no living organisms on Mars Climate change will reduce the resilience of forests An increase in protein X will lead to disease Y I don‚Äôt know about you; but I‚Äôm personally are much more inclined to identify those as hypotheses. But nothing has really changed were compared to the three statement regarding ‚Äúeveryday life‚Äù : we‚Äôre still making affirmations about something that will happen in certain conditions, which is a ‚Ä¶","date":1646870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646870400,"objectID":"1dc79319c3d4e1a765204a7c7f8b7511","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/post/hypothesis_and_predictions/","publishdate":"2022-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hypothesis_and_predictions/","section":"post","summary":"Why the difference can be subtle, and why we should be careful about distinguishing the two.","tags":["epistemiology","hypothesis","prediction"],"title":"Hypothesis and predictions","type":"post"},{"authors":["Cl√©ment Hardy"],"categories":null,"content":"So called ‚Äúvegan‚Äù diets and lifestyle have been a subject of debate, controversy, but also interest those past few years. The number of people trying this lifestyle have been soaring in the last decade; activists have been publishing more and more well-known documentaries revealing the dark side of animal agriculture; and many scientific studies have been advocating for the potential benefits of the lifestyle for the environment and climate change, as echoed by a recent special report of the IPCC.\nHowever, for many of us, veganism is a difficult and touchy subject. The whole concept can feel like an undeserved attack on traditions, jobs, or on other things that we hold dear. And yet, most of us agree with its ethical premises : we don‚Äôt like the idea of hurting or killing animals when it‚Äôs not needed for our survival, and especially not when it‚Äôs for pleasure, comfort or habits, and that‚Äôs just what veganism is. In fact, the original definition from the The Vegan Society (the oldest vegan organisation in the world which first coined the term) says :\nVeganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude‚Äîas far as is possible and practicable‚Äîall forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals.\nWhich is something that most of us would certainly find noble. But the resulting tension between following those principles - or being asked to - and trying to protect things we hold dear can lead to a severe anti-vegan bias that can be quite hard to overcome. I know that it has been hard on me for quite some time, and that I‚Äôm not completely free of it today.\nThis bias, associated with the incredible economic and ideological power of the animal agriculture industry, can make things hard to piece out when we look at the science behind vegan lifestyles. Some studies funded by the industry have been criticized by the scientific community; while the results of others have been exaggerated by activists to fit their narrative. Whole books are now dedicated to analyzing the process of deception steaming from there forces. Really, it‚Äôs hard to keep track.\nOne of the big current talking point about veganism concerns its ability to help us reduce our impacts on the environment, and especially on climate change. If one should summarized why in two sentences, we could say that it‚Äôs all about ecological efficiency : at each level of a food chain, a great amount of energy coming from the level before is lost. Therefore, eating animals or their secretions imply that a great deal of the energy given to them as food - plants - will not be transformed as food for humans, but lost for the metabolism of the animal that is fed from. Meanwhile, eating plants avoids this loss - doubly so because plants are autotrophic beings. This is why, in a very paradoxical way, eating plants instead of animals means that we require much less plants to begin with.\nAs I got interested in this subject, I came into the opportunity of updating an article concerning veganism on the famous website Skeptical Science, made by John Cook and his colleagues. While not perfect by any mean, I always admired the attempt at scientific rigor and communication that the site strives for. And so, after rounds of writing and peer-review, my version is now online. I think that it does a pretty great job at giving a broad picture of the topic, and its subtleties. The short answer is that yes, veganism can be a great way to reduce our impacts on the environment. It might in fact the best single behavioral change to help, if we take into account over variables than GHG emissions (like land use). The consensus about this emerging from recent studies and reports seems pretty clear and robust. Some studies even mention that such an individual and societal change will be necessary to reach our mitigation goals. However, it won‚Äôt save the world by itself, and some other behavioral changes (like avoiding to have a child or not taking the plane) might have a bigger impact on our climate footprint. But one can wonder : is it easier to never use a car or take the plane again, or to switch to a vegan diet ?\nWanna check out my article on Skeptical Science ? Click here ! Of course, this is just touching the ‚Äúenvironmental‚Äù argument for veganism, and not even touching the other environmental aspects (such as land-use, freshwater use, eutrophication, and biodiversity). Whatever the truth of the matter, I believe that our ethics always go first; that‚Äôs why none of us would start eating dogs, even if it was clearly proven that this would help fight climate change. Because of this, I recommend taking a closer look at what it really is to kill an animal; to imagine what we would feel if we were the ones slicing their throat, and facing their terrified gaze, all in order to eat a steak whose taste will be forgotten in a matter of minutes. And that if it is something that we couldn‚Äôt do ourselves out of compassion, kindness and courage, maybe it is something that we shouldn‚Äôt pay for ‚Ä¶","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"25e088924c33e11e402ef9e7eacde891","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/post/veganism_and_climate_change/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/veganism_and_climate_change/","section":"post","summary":"Plant-based diets have a high ecological efficiency; but is it really useful to help the planet ?","tags":["plant-based diets","climate change","veganism"],"title":"Veganism and climate change","type":"post"},{"authors":["Cl√©ment Hardy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646834766,"objectID":"cea6d60d5e967c9b65dfe1776147c80d","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/publication/hardy-veganism-best-way-2022/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T14:08:17.807561Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hardy-veganism-best-way-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Is Veganism the best way to reduce carbon emissions?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cl√©ment Hardy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646834769,"objectID":"3ea99172d35df9172d25c1018fe1b29c","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/publication/hardy-amenagement-forestier-inequien-2022/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T14:08:19.980776Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hardy-amenagement-forestier-inequien-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"L'am√©nagement forestier in√©quien : Solution ou mirage d'une foresterie durable ?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cl√©ment Hardy"],"categories":null,"content":" Uneven-aged forest management is perceived as offering attractive trade-offs between wood production, and other important ecosystem services.

We simulated 30 development scenarios in a landscape of the Mauricie region by varying the use of uneven-aged management methods and the aggregation of cuts.

And the wonderful news is that they are free, that they do not contain advertising, and that they do not sell information about yourself or your data.\nHere is a list of 3 open-source software that changed my life as a PhD student and early researcher, by allowing me to organize my references, my notes and my files like never before.\nJoplin Joplin is a note-taking application with many features.\nIt is an open-source and completely free software that allows you to create notes in the ‚ÄúMarkdown‚Äù writing language, and to organize them in ‚Äúnotebooks‚Äù, and associate them with tags. It is an excellent alternative to software such as Evernote or Microsoft One Note.\nIn particular, Joplin allows you to:\nGather all your written or graphic information in one place: your class notes, your thoughts, your projects, your recipes, your shopping lists, your to-do lists, etc. Find all this information very quickly (in a few seconds) thanks to the search tools. Use it on any computer (Windows, Mac, Linux) and on any phone (android, IOs). Synchronize your data on the cloud you choose : Nextcloud (see below), Google Drive, One Drive, etc. So you can have all your data written everywhere, all the time, on any media. Have a fully customizable interface that allows you to focus totally on what you are writing, so that you don‚Äôt waste time and attention. Export your notes in many ways, with a format (markdown) that can be read anywhere and at any time. Automatically manage the images and files you insert in your notes. Automatically edit your notes (so you can go back at any time if you made a mistake). And much more. Joplin is an amazing software to try your hand at note-taking tools, and maybe even at the Zettelkasten method !\nOther wondful alternatives include Zettlr, or Obsidian. However, I think that Joplin is the best place to start if you‚Äôre not used to such apps.\nTo download Joplin, take a look at its website !\nZotero Zotero is a bibliography management software.\nHaving complete and rigorous bibliography information is necessary in academic documents (thesis, dissertation, article). It can also be very important for blog or website posts, videos, scripts, and many others. It can additionally be very useful for managing personal resources. The bibliography information of a document is called ‚Äòmeta-data‚Äô, i.e. data about the document, but outside the document (its title, its publication date, its author(s), etc.).\nZotero allows you to :\nEasily save all the metadata associated with a document (title, authors, place of publication, date, URL, etc.). Associate notes or tags to each reference or document. Sort these references by categorys, or by their characteristics to find them easily. Download associated PDF files when possible. Export bibliography files that contain all the details of the references, so that they can be inserted into a document. Insert and manage the bibliography of a document in Microsoft Word, Libreoffice or Google Doc using its plugins. Zotero have a wonderful community that devellops incredible plugins such as Better BibTex, Zotfile or MDnotes. All of these will allow you to connect your Zotero database to other software such as Joplin, Zettlr and Obsidian, or to export the annotations that you make in your .pdf files.\nTo download Zotero, you can go on its website.\nNextcloud Nextcloud is a cloud software like Google Drive, allowing to host files, but also containing multiple very useful applications. However, unlike Google Drive, it is open-source and free. You only need to host it on a server yourself, or choose an host (free, or subscription-based).\nNextcloud allows you to:\nHave an online file storage space that is totally yours. Have access to lots of different applications all open-source that allow you to manage to-do lists, kanban boards, calendars, contacts, notes, recipes, maps, track your phone‚Äôs location, collaborate on documents, and much more. Nextcloud is an incredible way to boost your productivity by organizing simply across devices, and I cannot recommand it enough. It is also perfect to host your Joplin notes in the cloud, or your Zettlr or Obsidian files. You can even save the .pdf files of your zotero database with it ! Best of all, most of Nextcloud‚Äôs apps can synchronize very easily with your phone. Tasks on your phone ? Check. Calendar ? Check. Kanban boards ? Check. Recipes ? Check. The list goes on.\nTo find an host or download nextcloud and host it yourself, you should look at the project‚Äôs website.\nRemember to contribute !

While benefits of uneven-aged management have been reported at the stand-scale and for short time periods, uncertainties remain concerning its impacts for longer time periods and broader spatial scales. Of concern is the impact of forest roads. Indeed, uneven-aged forestry requires that silvicultural operations extend over larger forest areas than even-aged forestry in order to harvest the same volume of wood. Consequently, uneven-aged forestry may require a larger and more permanent forest road network to reach distant stands over shorter rotation periods.\nHere, we explored the impacts of uneven-aged management on the composition and fragmentation of a 800 000 ha landscape over a 150 years-planning horizon.

In addition, differences of fragmentation of the landscape between even-aged and uneven-aged management were lower in the northern region containing more boreal forest, as forest fires tended to fragment the old forests of the landscape in spite of any forest management.\nWe conclude that selecting uneven-aged over even-aged management should be closely linked to how fragmentation and habitat are defined, to the patterns of fragmentation as a result of natural disturbances, and to the perceived effects of fragmentation per se in the landscape. We also conclude that aggregation of the harvested areas could help to reduce the negative impacts of uneven-aged management, but that they are unlikely to entirely compensate them.\n","date":1620651600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620651600,"objectID":"00a9230b78968bde8fca00e095bfa8bb","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/talk/long-term-impacts-of-uneven-aged-development-on-the-quantity-and-fragmentation-of-old-growth-forest-in-a-landscape-cef/","publishdate":"2021-05-10T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/long-term-impacts-of-uneven-aged-development-on-the-quantity-and-fragmentation-of-old-growth-forest-in-a-landscape-cef/","section":"event","summary":"üèÜ This presentation won the ‚ÄúBest presentation‚Äù award for this annual symposium of the CEF.\nUneven-aged management is currently seen by many forest ecologists as an extensive management approach when compared to more traditional even-aged methods, offering interesting compromises between timber production and other important ecosystem services.","tags":["ecology","roads","uneven-aged forest management"],"title":"üìä üèÜ Long-term impacts of uneven-aged development on the quantity and fragmentation of old-growth forest in a landscape (CEF)","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1620046800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620046800,"objectID":"7e6d8cf0ddce5c836342ded424501fb5","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/talk/long-term-impacts-of-uneven-aged-management/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/long-term-impacts-of-uneven-aged-management/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"üìä Long term impacts of uneven-aged management","type":"event"},{"authors":["Fructueux G.

The study of their activity patterns is needed to better understand habitat use or association between the species. Using camera traps, we studied the temporal activity patterns, and quantified for the first time the temporal overlap and spatial co-occurrence between species. Our results show that: (i) Two species are strongly diurnal: Cephalophus leucogaster, and Philantomba congica, (ii) two species are mostly diurnal: C.callipygus and C. nigrifrons, (iii) one species is strongly nocturnal: C.castaneus, (iv) and one species is mostly nocturnal: C.silvicultor. Analyses of temporal activities (for five species) identified four species pairs that highly overlapped (Œîtextasciicircum‚â•¬†0.80), and six pairs that weakly overlapped (Œîtextasciicircum between 0.06 and 0.35). Finally, co-occurrence tests reveal a truly random co-occurrence (plt \u003e 0.05 and pgt \u003e 0.05) for six species pairs, and a positive co-occurrence (pgt \u003c 0.05) for four pairs. Positive co-occurrences are particularly noted for pairs formed by C.callipygus with the other species (except C. nigrifrons). These results are essential for a better understanding of the coexistence of duikers and the ecology of poorly known species (C. leucogaster and C. nigrifrons), and provide clarification on the activity patterns of C. silvicultor which was subject to controversy. Camera traps proved then to be a powerful tool for studying the activity patterns of free-ranging duiker populations.","tags":["camera traps","Central Africa","co-occurrence","daily activity patterns","duikers","overlap coefficient"],"title":"Daily Activity Patterns and Co-Occurrence of Duikers Revealed by an Intensive Camera Trap Survey across Central African Rainforests","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"üìë Description The FRS (Forest Roads Simulation) module is an extension for the LANDIS-II model.\nIt allows any user to dynamically simulate the evolution of the forest road network in the simulated landscape of LANDIS-II.

While the benefits of uneven-aged management have been reported at the stand-scale and on short time periods, uncertainties remain concerning the impacts of uneven-aged management on longer time and wider spatial scales. Of concern are the impact of forest roads, as uneven-aged management necessitate more permanent roads and an increased road usage in order to accommodate shorter harvest rotations. These could in turn increase permanent forest lost, fauna road mortality, carbon emissions and operational costs for the industry.\nTo explore this question, we compared the impact of uneven-aged management with that of even-aged management at large time and spatial scales. We created a road extension for the LANDIS-II landscape simulation model, whose goal is to simulate the construction of forest roads to reach harvesting areas in a dynamic and spatially explicit way. Road trajectories are computed by minimizing construction costs according to existing roads, elevation, topography, water bodies, and soil types. We developed 20 scenarios with different proportions of harvested areas managed with uneven-aged or even aged management methods, for a given harvest wood volume. The scenarios also differed in the level of aggregation of the harvested areas, and in the presence of a pre-existing forest roads. We tested these scenarios over a planning horizon of 300 years on a landscape of 5 million hectares in Mauricie, Canada, and measured several characteristics of the road network for each scenario.\nOur results will further our understanding of the long-term impacts of management strategies in forested landscapes, and will also open new opportunities to explore the impact of forest roads around the world.\n","date":1589288400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589288400,"objectID":"9bc66c10c1a4f8528f3b7085192abce1","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/talk/the-influence-of-forest-road-networks-on-the-long-term-impacts-of-uneven-aged-management/","publishdate":"2020-05-12T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/the-influence-of-forest-road-networks-on-the-long-term-impacts-of-uneven-aged-management/","section":"event","summary":"Uneven-aged forest management is currently seen by many forest ecologists as an extensive management approach offering interesting compromises between timber production and other important ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, and social acceptability.","tags":["ecology","roads","uneven-aged forest management"],"title":"üìä The influence of forest road networks on the long term impacts of uneven-aged management","type":"event"},{"authors":["Cl√©ment Hardy"],"categories":null,"content":"The caribou (Rangifer tarandus) faces many different pressures throughout Qu√©bec, making it a vulnerable species.

The goal of this tool is to prevent the disturbance of areas important to the caribou populations, and to detect existing roads that could be removed in order to improve the situation.\nThe tool had to respect many criteria: it had to be quick and easy to use, while being flexible enough to explore different user-defined scenarios. Each scenario generates a forest road network that expands across the forest areas to be harvested.

The more extensive uneven-aged forest management methods are currently presented by many researchers as an important alternative to the even-aged methods, but the impacts of their use have not yet been considered on a large scale.\nTo distinguish the effects of these methods at the landscape scale, however, we must take into account a process that has, to our knowledge, never been modeled in such a context: the construction of forest paths necessary for access to stands. To this end, we have started the development of a new extension for LANDIS-II. This extension will simulate the development and maintenance of a network of forest paths in a landscaped landscape, and the costs and effects associated with these paths. We will combine the use of this module with different forest management scenarios, in order to observe how the use of the Equian and Inequian methods influence the quantity and structure of paths in the landscape.\n","date":1556802000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556802000,"objectID":"c514ad3a3de2066a3f38afce52e0accf","permalink":"https://klemet.github.io/talk/a-new-landis-ii-module-to-study-the-effects-of-roads-on-forest-landscapes/","publishdate":"2019-05-02T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/a-new-landis-ii-module-to-study-the-effects-of-roads-on-forest-landscapes/","section":"event","summary":"LANDIS-II is a spatially explicit model to simulate the evolution of a forest landscape represented by a raster.

The geometric shape most used by modelers to cut out space is that of the square, which makes it possible to create regular grids, in addition to other advantages.

For this, we will reproduce the operation of several existing models well known in the field, and which represent an important process for forest ecosystems (e.g. natural disturbances). We will then run these models on different grids (e.g. square, hexagonal, irregular, etc.) to observe the effects of these on the results obtained.
