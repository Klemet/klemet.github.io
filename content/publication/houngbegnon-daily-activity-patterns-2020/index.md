abstract: 'The duiker community in Central African rainforests includes a diversity
  of species that can coexist in the same area. The study of their activity patterns
  is needed to better understand habitat use or association between the species. Using
  camera traps, we studied the temporal activity patterns, and quantified for the
  first time the temporal overlap and spatial co-occurrence between species. Our results
  show that: (i) Two species are strongly diurnal: Cephalophus leucogaster, and Philantomba
  congica, (ii) two species are mostly diurnal: C.callipygus and C. nigrifrons, (iii)
  one species is strongly nocturnal: C.castaneus, (iv) and one species is mostly nocturnal:
  C.silvicultor. Analyses of temporal activities (for five species) identified four
  species pairs that highly overlapped (&Delta;textasciicircum&ge;&nbsp;0.80), and
  six pairs that weakly overlapped (&Delta;textasciicircum between 0.06 and 0.35).
  Finally, co-occurrence tests reveal a truly random co-occurrence (plt &gt; 0.05
  and pgt &gt; 0.05) for six species pairs, and a positive co-occurrence (pgt &lt;
  0.05) for four pairs. Positive co-occurrences are particularly noted for pairs formed
  by C.callipygus with the other species (except C. nigrifrons). These results are
  essential for a better understanding of the coexistence of duikers and the ecology
  of poorly known species (C. leucogaster and C. nigrifrons), and provide clarification
  on the activity patterns of C. silvicultor which was subject to controversy. Camera
  traps proved then to be a powerful tool for studying the activity patterns of free-ranging
  duiker populations.'
