I am a **postdoctoral fellow at the Université du Québec en Outaouais (UQO)**.

My research tries to explore the effects of different forest management strategies on forests landscapes. To do that, I used and develloped several open-source tools made for researchers.

Due to the nature of my research and hobbies, I develloped through time skills in programming, management, organisation and leadership. I tend to hone those skills by develloping and supporting open-source software, and by helping different groups and projects with whom I collaborate in and out of my professional life.
