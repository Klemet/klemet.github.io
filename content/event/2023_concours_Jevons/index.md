A yearly science communication contest is held by a gathering of several research groups of the UQAM, the p√¥le ISE-CIRODD-RIISQ. The theme of the 2023 edition of the contest was *Transitions, decarbonization and resilience*. 

I participated with a very short article talking about [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) and its implications concerning the consumption of more effective products and "green" (e.g. cars, planes, etc.). I concluded that based on the Jevons paradox and existing empirical data, more efficient vehicules, electronic devices or agricultural methods can create more environmental problems that they solve.

To my surprise, I won the second prize ! If you're curious, you can check out the article I subbmited by clicking on the **PDF** button at the top of the page.
