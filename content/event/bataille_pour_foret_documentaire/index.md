The forests in Quebec are facing a lot of different pressures, resulting in different stakeholders arguing for different actions to help them. As a result, Savoir Media (a quebec TV channel) made a documentary regarding the issue. 

I was briefly interview during one of the episodes of the documentary, to talk about my current research regarding the impact of potential new ways to manage Quebec's forests.
