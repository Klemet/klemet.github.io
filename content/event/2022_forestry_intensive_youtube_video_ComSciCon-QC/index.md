The ComSciCon is an amazing series of workshops and conferences made to help students of science communicate their research better through many different media.

In QuÃ©bec, the ComSciCon-QC is now organized every year by brave volonteers. I participated at the 2022 edition at the UDEM in MontrÃ©al. For the occasion, every participant had to produce a work of science communication that would be reviewed by a team.

I choose to create a youtube video that explored the subject of intensive forestry, the Javon's paradox, and the sharing/sparing question of ecology. You can watch this video right here ! **Although, remember that the video is in french !**
