## ðŸ“‘ Description

The FRS (Forest Roads Simulation) module is an extension for the [LANDIS-II](http://www.landis-ii.org/) model.

It allows any user to dynamically simulate the evolution of the forest road network in the simulated landscape of LANDIS-II. It does so by creating roads to cells that are harvested by a harvest module (such as [Base Harvest](http://www.landis-ii.org/extensions/base-harvest) or [Biomass Harvest](http://www.landis-ii.org/extensions/biomass-harvest)), while reducing the costs of construction of roads as much as possible.
