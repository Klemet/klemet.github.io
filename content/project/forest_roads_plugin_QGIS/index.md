## ðŸ“‘ Description

This plugin contains several algorithms destined to help the user create an optimized forest road network, based on the topography of the landscape.

The user must first create or input a "cost map", which describes the cost of construction of a road on a pixel. Then, different algorithms allows the user to create the road network, then simulate the fluxes of wood going through it (transport via timber trucks), then decide the width and type of each road segment according to this flux.
